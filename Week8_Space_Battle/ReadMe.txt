Dear Blizzard,

Enclosed is a .zip archive of a game I've recently developed, titled Space Battle.  This project is about battles in space 
and the main point of it is to create a simple game. The project is about shooting objects as they approach the ship.
My career goal is to to become a programmer and this project highlights my experience in this field through the gameplay of defending
the ship.  I look forward to working with you and making a strong contribution to your team.
Sincerely,
Harry Pham
