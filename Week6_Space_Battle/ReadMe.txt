1. TITLE: The title of my project is Stranded Ship.  I chose this title because the ship in the game is stranded and is fighting the
enemies with it's engiens damaged.
2. TOPIC: The topic of my project is about battles in space.
3. ARGUMENT: My main point in my project is to show that battles in space will become more difficult as remains from
other ships that were destroyed get in the way of shots
4. CHANGING THE WORLD: If this project could change the world, it would show that battles in space aren't worth it when
humans heads into space in the future.
5. STORY: My project is about battles in space
6. GAMEPLAY: I communicate my argument and story by leaving debris when ships or asteroids get destroyed.
7. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT: Things that are not yet completed in my project include: Allowing player ship to move and 
accelerate, movement other than circling for the enemy ship, making asteroids bounce off screen instead of removing them
instead of adding more asteroids to increase difficulty

Changes in this version:
Enemy ships can now be shot at, and when they die they block shots from the player.
