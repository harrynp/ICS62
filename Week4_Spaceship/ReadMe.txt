The ship is moved by moving the mouse and shoots by clicking the mouse button.  Asteroids will come flying towards the
ship and you must destroy them by shooting them.  The ship's shields automatically regenerate after a certain amount of
time and the ship will be destroyed if the shields hit 0.  As time passes, the difficulty grows harder and more asteroids will
aproach the ship.
