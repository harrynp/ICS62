Pacman in this game moves automatically.  The ghosts move in a levy walk until they detect pacman, which they will go after
if detected.  Pacman can be controlled by using the WSAD keys.  Powerups occasionally appear on the screen in blue boxes.
Each powerup obtained will add 10 seconds of doubled speed to pacman.  If a ghost catches pacman, the game is over.
